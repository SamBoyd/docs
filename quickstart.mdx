## Prerequisites

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="docker" title="Docker and Docker Compose">
    OpenBacklog runs as a set of Docker containers. Install Docker Desktop from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="code-branch" title="Git">
    You'll need Git to clone the repository. Install from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Step 1: Clone and Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/samboyd/openbacklog.git
cd openbacklog

# Start the services
docker-compose --env-file .env.cluster-dev up
```

<Tip>
First startup may take a few minutes while Docker downloads images and builds containers.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Access the App

Once the services are running, open your browser to:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

You'll see the OpenBacklog dashboard where you can create your first workspace.

## Step 3: Connect Your AI

OpenBacklog uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to integrate with AI tools you already use.
