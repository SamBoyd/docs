## Overview

OpenBacklog exposes a REST API through PostgREST, which automatically generates endpoints from the PostgreSQL database schema.

<Info>
Full API documentation is coming soon. In the meantime, you can explore the API using Swagger UI.
</Info>

## Viewing the API with Swagger UI

The PostgREST instance exposes an OpenAPI specification at its root endpoint. You can visualize and interact with the API using Swagger UI:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e SWAGGER_JSON_URL=http://localhost:3000/ swaggerapi/swagger-ui
```

Then open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

<Note>
Replace `3000` with your PostgREST port if you're using a different cluster configuration. See the [Docker Compose deployment guide](/self-hosting/docker-compose) for port mappings.
