description: "Connect Claude Code to OpenBacklog via MCP"
---

## Overview

OpenBacklog integrates with AI tools via the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/). This lets you use your existing Claude subscription to manage tasks, create initiatives, and plan your roadmap using natural language.

**BYOA (Bring Your Own AI):** OpenBacklog doesn't include AI - it connects to AI tools you already use.

## Step 1: Install Claude Code

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

See the [official Claude Code documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) for detailed installation instructions.

## Step 2: Configure MCP Server

Add OpenBacklog to your Claude Code MCP configuration. Use the Claude Code cli:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport=http OpenBacklog localhost:8000/mcp/
```

## Available Tools

Once connected, Claude Code can help you with:
