description: "Connect Claude Code to OpenBacklog via MCP"
---

## Overview

OpenBacklog integrates with AI tools via the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/). This lets you use your existing Claude subscription to manage tasks, create initiatives, and plan your roadmap using natural language.

**BYOA (Bring Your Own AI):** OpenBacklog doesn't include AI - it connects to AI tools you already use.

## Step 1: Install Claude Code

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

See the [official Claude Code documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) for detailed installation instructions.

## Step 2: Configure MCP Server

OpenBacklog provides two MCP server modes optimized for different workflows:

**Execution Mode** (5 tools) - Minimal toolset for coding workflows:
- Query and update initiatives
- Query and update tasks
- Get strategic context summary

**Planning Mode** (35+ tools) - Full toolset for strategic planning:
- All execution tools
- Framework tools for vision, pillars, outcomes, themes
- Hero, villain, and conflict management
- Roadmap prioritization

### Why Two Servers?

LLMs have a fixed context window, and every MCP tool definition consumes tokens whether the tool is used or not. When you're focused on **implementation** (pulling down a task and coding), you don't need 35+ strategic planning tools consuming your context window.

**The Problem:**
- Tool definitions take up valuable context space
- More tools = less room for code, conversation, and reasoning
- When coding, you rarely need framework tools, hero/villain management, or roadmap prioritization

**The Solution:**
- **Execution server**: Only 5 essential tools (~85% reduction)
- **Strategy server**: Full 35+ toolset for when you're planning
- Use the right server for the right job

**Benefits:**
- More context available for actual code when implementing
- Faster AI tool selection with fewer options to consider
- Clear mental model: "I'm coding" vs "I'm planning"
- Better performance and lower API costs

### Recommended: Dual-Server Configuration

For best performance, configure both servers. Use the execution server when coding, and the strategy server when planning:

```bash
# Add execution server (minimal tools for coding)
claude mcp add --transport=http OpenBacklogCoding localhost:8000/mcp/execution

# Add strategy server (full toolset for planning)
claude mcp add --transport=http OpenBacklogPlanning localhost:8000/mcp/planning
```

### Managing MCP Servers

Once configured, you can dynamically enable and disable MCP servers during your Claude Code session using the `/mcp` command:


## Available Tools

Once connected, Claude Code can help you with:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="list-check" title="Task Management">
    - View, create, and update tasks
    - Manage checklists within tasks
    - Track task status (Backlog → To Do → In Progress → Done)
    - Search and filter tasks
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="folder" title="Initiative Management">
    - Create and organize initiatives
    - Link tasks to initiatives
    - Track initiative progress
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="compass" title="Strategic Planning">
    - Define and update product vision
    - Create strategic pillars and outcomes
    - Manage roadmap themes
    - Link themes to outcomes
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="book-open" title="Narrative Tools">
    - Define heroes (user personas)
    - Identify villains (problems to solve)
    - Track conflicts between heroes and villains
    - Generate "Previously On..." recaps
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Example Prompts

```text
"Show me my current tasks"
"Create a new initiative for user authentication"
"What's my product vision?"
"Help me break down this feature into tasks"
"What conflicts are we trying to resolve?"
"Give me a Previously On recap"
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="circle-xmark" title="Connection refused">
    Ensure OpenBacklog is running. Start it with:
    ```bash
    docker-compose --env-file .env.development up
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="lock" title="Authentication failed">
    Clear your browser cookies for localhost and try authenticating again. The auth flow opens in your default browser.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="puzzle-piece" title="Tools not appearing">
    Restart Claude Code after updating your MCP configuration. The tools should appear in Claude Code's tool list.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
