## Overview

OpenBacklog integrates with AI tools via the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/). This lets you use Cursor's AI features to manage tasks, create initiatives, and plan your roadmap using natural language.

**BYOA (Bring Your Own AI):** OpenBacklog doesn't include AI - it connects to AI tools you already use.

## Step 1: Configuration Location

Cursor reads MCP server configuration from JSON files:

- **Project-level:** `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project directory
- **Global:** `~/.cursor/mcp.json` in your home directory

Create or edit the appropriate file based on your preference.

## Step 2: Configure MCP Servers

OpenBacklog provides two MCP server modes optimized for different workflows:

**Execution Mode** (5 tools) - Minimal toolset for coding workflows:
- Query and update initiatives
- Query and update tasks
- Get strategic context summary

**Planning Mode** (35+ tools) - Full toolset for strategic planning:
- All execution tools
- Framework tools for vision, pillars, outcomes, themes
- Hero, villain, and conflict management
- Roadmap prioritization

### Recommended: Dual-Server Configuration

For best performance, configure both servers:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "OpenBacklogCoding": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp/execution"
    },
    "OpenBacklogPlanning": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp/planning"
    }
  }
}
```

### Why Two Servers?

LLMs have a fixed context window, and every MCP tool definition consumes tokens whether the tool is used or not. When you're focused on **implementation** (pulling down a task and coding), you don't need 35+ strategic planning tools consuming your context window.

**The Problem:**
- Tool definitions take up valuable context space
- More tools = less room for code, conversation, and reasoning
- When coding, you rarely need framework tools, hero/villain management, or roadmap prioritization

**The Solution:**
- **Execution server**: Only 5 essential tools (~85% reduction)
- **Strategy server**: Full 35+ toolset for when you're planning
- Use the right server for the right job

**Benefits:**
- More context available for actual code when implementing
- Faster AI tool selection with fewer options to consider
- Clear mental model: "I'm coding" vs "I'm planning"
- Better performance and lower API costs

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="circle-xmark" title="Connection refused">
    Ensure OpenBacklog is running. Start it with:
    ```bash
    docker-compose --env-file .env.cluster-dev up
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="file-code" title="Invalid JSON configuration">
    Verify your `mcp.json` file has valid JSON syntax. Common issues:
    - Trailing commas after the last item
    - Missing quotes around keys or values
    - Mismatched braces
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="puzzle-piece" title="Tools not appearing">
    Restart Cursor after updating your MCP configuration. The tools should appear when you start a new AI chat.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rotate" title="Changes not taking effect">
    Cursor caches MCP server connections. Close all Cursor windows and restart the application to reload the configuration.
