## Overview

OpenBacklog organizes work into a simple hierarchy:

- **Initiatives** group related work toward a goal
- **Tasks** are individual units of work
- **Checklists** break tasks into smaller steps

This structure gives you enough organization to track complex projects without the overhead of enterprise tools.

## Initiatives

Initiatives are containers for related tasks. Use them to group work that contributes to a single goal or feature.

**When to create an initiative:**
- Starting a new feature or project
- Addressing a specific user need
- Tackling a technical improvement

**Initiative fields:**
- **Title** - What you're building or fixing
- **Description** - Context, goals, and acceptance criteria
- **Status** - Backlog, To Do, In Progress, or Done

## Tasks

Tasks are the units of work within initiatives. Each task represents something you can complete in a focused work session.

**Task fields:**
- **Title** - Clear, actionable description
- **Description** - Details, notes, and implementation context
- **Status** - Backlog → To Do → In Progress → Done
- **Checklist** - Subtasks or steps to complete

<Tip>
Keep tasks small enough to complete in one session. If a task feels too big, break it into multiple tasks or use checklists.
</Tip>

## Status Workflow

Both initiatives and tasks follow the same status workflow:

```
BACKLOG → TO_DO → IN_PROGRESS → DONE
```

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Backlog** | Captured but not committed to |
| **To Do** | Committed and ready to start |
| **In Progress** | Actively being worked on |
| **Done** | Completed |

## Checklists

Checklists break tasks into smaller steps. They're useful for:

- Multi-step implementations
- Review or QA processes
- Remembering edge cases

Each checklist item can be marked complete independently, giving you progress visibility within a task.

## Working with AI

When connected via MCP, your AI assistant can help manage tasks:

```text
"Create a task for implementing user login"
"Add a checklist to the current task with test cases"
"Move the auth task to In Progress"
"What tasks are blocking the login initiative?"
```
